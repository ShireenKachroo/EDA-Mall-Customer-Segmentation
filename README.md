# Mall Customer Segmentation - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Mall Customer Segmentation using Python. The goal of the analysis is to understand customer behavior based on features like age, income, and spending score, which can be used for targeted marketing strategies and customer clustering.

> **Platform Used**: Google Colab  
> **Dataset**: Mall_Customers.csv

##  Overview

Customer segmentation is a key task in understanding customer preferences and creating data-driven business strategies. In this project, I:

- Explored and visualized customer data.
- Identified trends and patterns using graphs and statistical insights.
- Laid the groundwork for clustering customers.

---

## Objectives

- Understand the distribution of customer features.
- Discover relationships between variables such as **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**.
- Gain actionable insights that can help in business decision-making or further modeling.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

| Feature         | Description                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `CustomerID`    | Unique ID assigned to each customer      |
| `Gender`        | Male/Female                              |
| `Age`           | Age of the customer                      |
| `Annual Income` | Annual income of the customer (k$)       |
| `Spending Score`| Score assigned by the mall (1-100)       |

##  Key Insights

- Distribution of customers by gender, age groups, and income levels.
- Correlation between income and spending score.
